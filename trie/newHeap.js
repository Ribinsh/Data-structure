// step 1   create a function for maxHeap 

// step 2   loop the given array for each element 

// step 3  push them  one by one in to the heap function by using loop

// step 4 in the heap function will collect the given element in to its leaf node

// step 5 (heepify)    then it will compare the element with parrent node .  if element is greater than parrent node elemnt 
//  will replace with the parrent node and the procedure will continue untill element become less than parrent node 
//  or it replace the root node  


//  step 6  push all the element to the heap until last



let arr = [2,7,5,1,3,2]
